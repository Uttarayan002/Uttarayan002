**Data Science | Insight-Driven Problem Solver with Business Context**

Welcome to my GitHub !

## About
Well as you can see from my profile, I'm a computer science graduate passionate about translating raw data into business insights. Currently focus in Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning with hands-
on projects. I solve business problems through data, systems thinking, and experimentation. My work spans from analyzing case studies and Key performance indicators to building machine learning models that 
provide values for decisions. I approach problems with a mix of technical skill and business sense,  aiming not just for accuracy, but for impact. I love transforming data into decisions.

 ### ***I believe in continuous learning, fast iteration, and contributing to data-driven business growth.***
