# Hi, I'm Uttarayan 
**Data Science | Insight-Driven Problem Solver with Business Context**

Welcome to my GitHub! I solve business problems through data, systems thinking, and experimentation. 

## About
Well as you can see from my profile, I'm a computer science graduate passionate about translating raw data into business insights. Currently upskilling in Data Science and Reinforcement Learning with hands-on 
projects. A strong foundation in Python, SQL, Machine Learning passionate about solving real-world problems with data. My work spans from analyzing case studies and Key performance indicators to building 
machine learning models that provide values for decisions.
I approach problems with a mix of technical skill and business sense â€” aiming not just for accuracy, but for impact. Whether it's reducing forecasting errors, preventing fraud in biometric systems, or 
optimizing inventory through dynamic pricing, I love transforming data into decisions.

Currently focused on:
- Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Transformers.
- Building a **Dynamic Pricing Engine** using Reinforcement Learning & Time Series Forecasting
- Exploring **Product & Revenue Analytics** in e-commerce environments
- Creating **dashboard-ready, business-focused flat datasets** from raw data

***I believe in continuous learning, fast iteration, and contributing to data-driven business growth.***
