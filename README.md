**Future-Ready Data Scientist | Solving Real-World Problems with Business context**

Well as you can see from my profile, I am passionate about turning raw data into valuable business insights. Right now, I am focused on Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. I work on hands-on projects 
to improve my skills. I specialize in solving business issues through data analysis, systems thinking, and experimentation. My work includes analyzing case studies and developing Key Performance Indicators 
(KPIs) and machine learning models that help with decision-making.
I tackle problems by combining business knowledge and technical skills. I aim not just for correctness but also for impact and value. I enjoy transforming data into actionable decisions and always look for 
chances to learn and grow in this fast-changing field. 

***I believe in continuous learning, fast iteration, and contributing to data-driven business growth.***
